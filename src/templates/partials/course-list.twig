          this topic from the point of view of the project manager, the localization engineer, and even the translator. The
          hands-on style of this course will put students in situations that require critical thinking, risk mitigation skills
          and solid knowledge of the web localization industry—all of which will be honed throughout this class. Specifically,
          we will be covering the following topics: creating and localizing websites using opensource frameworks such as WordPress
          and Drupal, web technologies such as HTML, CSS and responsive design and JavaScript, wiki technology such as MediaWiki
          and Dokuwiki, bug tracking in Jira and The Bug Genie, and proxy localization such as Transifex and Smartling.</p>
