You’ll take hands-on courses in language, management, and technology; develop cross-cultural understanding and communication; and build highly marketable skills.
      </p>

        Language, Business, and Technology
      </h2>
      <p>
        Localization is the process of adapting the content related to an idea, service, or product to the language and culture of a specific market or region.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our master’s program is ideal if you’re interested in working at the intersection of language, culture, business, and technology. Our graduates work in a range of roles, including as localization program managers and language leads at tech firms like Netflix and Google, and as project managers at translation companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll study at our Monterey, California, campus, located in a beautiful, multicultural area that’s home to a high concentration of localization companies.
